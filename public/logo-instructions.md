# QuickMed Logo Instructions

To add your QuickMed logo to the application:

1. Place your logo file in this `public` folder
2. Name it `quickmed-logo.png` (or update the path in `src/components/Header.tsx`)
3. Recommended size: 40x40 pixels or larger (it will be scaled to 40x40)
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG

The app will automatically use your logo once it's placed here. If no logo is found, it will fallback to the Package icon.

Current logo path expected: `/quickmed-logo.png`
